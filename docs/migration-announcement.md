# 📢 KREX Migration is Live

The KREX Token is evolving. With the release of native smart contracts on Kaspa, we're transitioning away from the legacy Kasplex protocol into fully native, trustless infrastructure.

## 🔁 Options Available:
- 🔥 **Burn + Mint 1:1** — Swap old KREX for native
- 📸 **Claim from Snapshot** — For passive holders
- ⏳ **Dual Phase** — Temporary overlap of both tokens

## 📅 Deadline:
Claim and swap must be completed by: **[TO BE SET]**

## 🧠 Why This Matters:
- Native token = full dApp compatibility
- More secure, more scalable
- No 3rd-party dependencies
