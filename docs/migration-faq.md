# ❓ KREX Migration FAQ

### Q: Why are we migrating?
Kasplex tokens are third-party and not trustless. With native smart contracts, KREX becomes a true on-chain asset.

### Q: Will my old KREX still work?
Only during the dual-phase window. After that, native KREX becomes the only valid version.

### Q: Do I need to pay gas fees?
Yes — a small fee in KAS will be required. It will go to the official treasury wallet.

### Q: What if I miss the deadline?
Unclaimed tokens may be burned or redirected to community vaults or governance.
