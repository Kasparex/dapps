🧩 Official Kasparex dApp Listing Process
(Step-by-step for Builders, Dev Teams, and Community Moderation)

🧱 1. Ideation & Planning
Define the problem your dApp solves and its intended users.

Follow the UaaS (Utility-as-a-Service) structure:

Modular utility

Easily embeddable

Token-agnostic or KRC-20 specific

Review Kasparex UI standards:

Clean UI, white background

Rounded corners, light shadow

Roboto font

Buttons: #0097b2 background, white text

Info icons for explanations

Responsive design (mobile+desktop)

💻 2. Development
Start with a Kasparex widget template (available via Dev Groups).

Use Velo (for Wix) or clean HTML/CSS/JS structure.

Minimize external dependencies. Keep it lightweight.

Add functionality first. Beautify it later based on UI specs.

🔐 3. Kaspa Smart Contract Integration
Simulate or deploy Kaspa smart contracts using official syntax.

Use the following typical dApp contract patterns:

Wallet signature verifications

NFT/token gating

Action triggers (like vote, claim, etc.)

Hash timestamp records

Include revenue-sharing logic (optional):

Example: 90% to builder wallet, 10% to Kasparex treasury.

🧪 4. Testing in Dev Groups Playground
🔧 Dev Groups Role:
Every builder or dev team that creates a dApp is required to moderate and manage a dedicated Dev Group for:

Feedback gathering

Feature requests

Early access links

Bug reports

Live changelogs

🧪 Testing Procedure:
Post your dApp to your own Dev Group using the pinned “Testing Panel Template.”

Include:
