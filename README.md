# Kaspa dApps

Creating decentralized applications (dApps) with simple copy-and-paste widgets and plug-and-use plugins powered by Smart Contracts on Kaspa.

This repository provides basic examples for quickly adding Kaspa-powered functionality to your project.

## Quick start

1. Choose a widget from the `widgets` directory.
2. Copy the snippet into your web application.
3. Configure the options to suit your needs.
4. Deploy your dApp and go live.

## Widgets

Each widget is a standalone snippet that can be embedded directly into a webpage. The snippets demonstrate how you might interact with Kaspa smart contracts without writing complex code.

See the `widgets` folder for examples such as:

- `payment-widget.html` – minimal example showing how to embed a Kaspa payment form.
- `kiwi-wallet-widget.html` – connects to the [Kasplex Kiwi SDK](https://github.com/kasplex/sdk-kiwi) for in-wallet interactions.
